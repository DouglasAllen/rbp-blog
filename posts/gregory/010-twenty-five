This is the 25th post to RBP blog!  Hooray!

We've been really happy with how things have gone so far.  Conversations have been for the most part civil and lively, we haven't run out of content, and the blog has seen new content nearly every week.

I know that we aren't seeing as many voices on a week to week basis as we hoped for, but let's face it, people are bound to get busy.  That having been said, it'd be great to know what readers are thinking about our content so far.

So, what do you think?  Ranging from technical issues to ones of personal taste, it'd be nice to know what keeps RBP in your feed reader, and what we can do to keep it there.  All feedback is welcome, so go ahead and let us know what's on your mind.

If you've got a great idea for a post, a series, or just some minor nitpick you want to voice, go for it.  So far we've gained a lot from user responses, so I'd like to keep with that tradition and keep the feedback loop tight.

Now that you've seen 25 posts, how should the next 25 look?
