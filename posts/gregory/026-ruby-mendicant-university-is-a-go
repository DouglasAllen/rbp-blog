Details on how to get involved with my new Ruby Mendicant University idea.
=entry
<i>Born less than 24 hours ago, my "Ruby Mendicant University idea":http://blog.rubybestpractices.com/posts/gregory/025-ruby-mendicant-university.html is already more than a third of the way to having its "initial costs  covered.":http://pledgie.com/campaigns/11063 In less than 12 hours, we've had 35 people "request a copy of the entrance exam.":http://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?formkey=dHlLM2E1ZllqN2hSWWhIWFBXRmthN2c6MQ So now that the idea is validated, it's time to begin on the execution.</i>

<small><i>PS: This morning, I decided that "I want to consolidate my blogging and tweeting,":http://seacreature.posterous.com/19694115 so most of my content will be posted to my new posterous blog rather than here at RBP blog.   Also, I am moving my twitter account over to "@seacreature":http://twitter.seacreature exclusively, rather than using "@rubypractices.":http://twitter.com/rubypractices   While this isn't quite an announcement of ending the RBP Blog project, it's a step in that direction.  Thanks so much for your attention and feedback over the last year or so.  Hope to see you on the other side!</i></small>
