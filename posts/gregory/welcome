=title Welcome to the RBP blog
=description This blog will hopefully be a great community resource for Ruby developers who are constantly in search of better coding practices and techniques. Although it'll be a few days before things get rolling, I'm happy to announce the project and the great group of collaborators we've put together.

Hello, and welcome to the Ruby Best Practices blog.  I am happy to announce this new collaborative Ruby blog, along with the great team that'll be running it.  A couple weeks ago I put out a call for volunteers to help me provide a new community resource for discovering and discussing best practices in Ruby, and now, we're ready to get rolling.

In addition to myself, <a href="/about/jamesbritt">James Britt</a>, <a href="/about/wyhaines">Kirk Haines</a>, <a href="/about/rklemme">Robert Klemme</a>, <a href="/about/jm">Jeremy McAnally</a>, <a href="/about/seanohalpin">Sean O'Halpin</a>, <a href="/about/judofyr">Magnus Holm</a> and <a href="/about/laken">Lakshan Perera</a> round out the team.
