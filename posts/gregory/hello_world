=title Hello World (Literally)
=description 
A quick look at of a map of where in the world our traffic has come from in the last few days, along with a few questions for our readers.

If Google Analytics is right, we've reached 68 countries in the last three days.  Although I guess this doesn't mean much at all on the internet, I think it still makes for a pretty map:

<table style="width:auto;"><tr><td><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/-OyFgPdlht14elpNP9-G8A?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_hoiny8_4IEY/Sf_dRKHgzcI/AAAAAAAAALM/yFs0gVNO1To/s800/blog-rbp.png" width="600" /></a></td></tr><tr><td style="font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:11px; text-align:right">From <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/gregory.t.brown/RBP?feat=embedwebsite">RBP</a></td></tr></table>

Of course, I'd like to back up these statistics with some direct data, so I've got three questions for our readers:

* Where are you from?
* What is the Ruby scene like where you live?
* What would you like to see on the RBP blog?

Please join in the conversation and let us know who you are.  So far, the discussions on this blog have been great and I want to get to know more of our readers.  We'll resume regularly scheduled deep tech content soon, but hopefully this small diversion will prove to be interesting.
