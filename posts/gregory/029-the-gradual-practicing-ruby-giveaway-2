Now that my paid newsletter is wrapping up, I've decided to bring this blog back to life by gradually releasing back issues for the enjoyment of RBP blog readers. We also decided to do a small rebranding in the process.

It's no secret that while the Ruby Best Practices blog rocked the house in 2009, we've pretty much been Pinin' For The Fjords in recent months. As is the case with most hackers, we all simply got too busy to continue working on the RBP blog. But every cloud has a silver lining, and because one of the projects keeping me busy was a massive writing project done in private, I now have lots of materials to share with the former RBP readers!

Starting today, I'm going to be releasing back issues from the Practicing Ruby newsletter twice a week, on Tuesdays and Thursdays. I'm hoping that this gradual posting schedule will give adequate time to have discussions about each topic, and possibly inspire wholly new content to be posted on occasion. Because that means a total of 30 posts in the next few months, we've decided to go ahead and rename this blog the _Practicing Ruby_ blog.

I look forward to interacting with the readers of this blog once again. That was always one of the best parts of working on this project, and that alone makes it worthwhile for me to share the archives of my previously commercial newsletter with you!
