=description This is the first article in the series of our guest author Eric Wong about Unix systems programming (USP).

* You should know basic Ruby syntax.
* Bourne shell knowledge will be useful, but not required.
* You do not need to know C, though I'll refer to and map Ruby methods to corresponding or analogous C functions.
* You must know that that two (or more) variables (in Ruby) can refer to the same underlying object.  This concept is present in Unix, so it is _very_ important one understand this:

<pre name="code" class="ruby">
       a = "this is a string"
       b = a      # 'b' refers to the same String object as 'a'
       a << "!"   # modifies the String object 'a' points to

       "this is a string!" == a

       # You should understand why the following statements are true:
       "this is a string!" == b
       "this is a string" != b
</pre>

h2. Notations/conventions

* Ruby method documentation references (should be the same as Ruby documentation)
** IO.pipe -- class/singleton method
** IO#stat -- instance method
* C function documentation references
** pipe(2) -- "#{function_name}(#{section})"
               The C function manpage can be accessed as:
                    man #{section} #{function_name}
               so you can open documentation for pipe(2) using the command: man 2 pipe

That's all I can think of for now...
