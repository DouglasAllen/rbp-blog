_Sorry to interrupt you, but you've totally lost me. What *is* this "Sexp"
you're speaking of? I've heard it before, but never quite understood it..._

Oh, don't feel sorry!  It's still quite esoteric for Rubyists.

_Yeah..._

Okay.  Let's start at the beginning.  Lisp!

_With all the parenthesis?_

Bingo!  Have you tried it?

_Not really.  It seems a little too "hardcore", if you know what I mean?_

Ah, yes. It's just a neat little language, nothing to be afraid of. Let me
show you an example:

<pre>
(define (plus-five n)
  (+ n 5))
</pre>

_It's a method that adds five to the argument?  Like this:_

<pre name="code" class="ruby">
def plus_five(n)
  n + 5
end
</pre>

Yep, but more importantly: It's also an example of S-expressions. Because Sexp
is really just a data format.

_Data format?  Like YAML?_

Just like YAML.  It has support for numbers, symbols, pairs, lists and nil.

_Really?_

Let me explain a few more things. You see, Lisp wasn't originally supposed to
be programmed in S-expression. Nope, the idea was to have complex,
human-readable _M-expressions_ which should manipulate data in S-expressions.

<pre>
    Data  =  S-expressions
    Code  =  M-expressions
</pre>

Another idea was that M-expressions could easily be compiled into
S-expressions. So the computer itself would only work with S-expressions,
while humans could focus on M-expressions.

<pre>
    M-expressions  -->   S-expressions
</pre>

However, the first Lisp implementations only accepted S-expressions since it
was easier to start from there and rather add M-expression support later.

_So what happend with these M-expressions?_

They were "receded into the indefinite future" as the creator, John McCarthy,
said. It turned out that S-expressions were readable enough.

_Go on, please._

Now Lisp suddenly used S-expressions for both code and data. The interesting
thing is how code was represented in Lisp. It's in fact very simple: The first
element in the list is the operator/function and the rest is the
operands/arguments:

<pre>
    (+ 1 2)
    (plus-five 5)
    (factorial 10)
</pre>

This makes Lisp a very simple language to implement. You need very few
primitives before you have a fully working Lisp system. In fact, I would
recommend watching James Coglan's screencast. There isn't any audio since he
used it in a talk he gave, but it's still fairy interesting.

_Wow.  I must definitely check out Lisp._

Indeed. He's also written a "real" Lisp implementation in Ruby if you're
interested: "Heist":http://github.com/jcoglan/heist. Oh, and I'll also have to
recommend "The Little Schemer":http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/BTLS/ by
Daniel P. Friedman and Matthias Felleisen, it has inspired me in several
ways...

_I will, but back to Sexp?_

No.  Let's talk about AST.

_AST? While *I* certainly appreciate these digressions, (_whispers_) others
might be a little bored, you know?_

Don't worry, this is pretty essential. An Abstract Syntax Tree is a tree
representation of source code. Compilers and interpreters never work directly
on the source code, but parses it into an AST which is much easier work with.
Your Ruby example above could look something like:

<pre>
[Def,
  plus_five
  [n]
  [Call, n, +, [[Lit, 5]]]]
</pre>

The basic idea here is that we only deal with _nodes_ like Def, Call and Lit,
and every node has a set of _children_. In this tree the nodes are built like
this:

<pre>
[Def, method_name, arguments, body] # => def method_name(*arguments); body; end
[Lit, number]                       # => (integer)
[Call, receiver, method_name, arguments] # => receiver.method_name(*arguments)
</pre>

_I think I get your point.  This is very similar to S-expressions!_

<pre>
(def plus_five (n)
  (call n + 5))
</pre>

Yes! It turns out that S-expressions are excellent to represent abstract
syntax trees. And when compiler gurus talk about S-expressions, they don't
talk about the file format, they talk about the way Lisp represent it's code:
The first element in the list is the operator/function and the rest are the
operands/arguments.

_So S-expressions themselves aren't very exciting, it all depends on what you
put in them?_

Exactly.  The Sexp-class basically looks like this:

<pre name="code" class="ruby">
class Sexp < Array
  def sexp_type
    self[0]
  end
  
  def sexp_body
    self[1..-1]
  end
end
</pre>

A glorified Array.  That's all there is to it.

_And what do people put in these Sexps?_

Let me show you an example. First, @gem install ruby_parser@. Then:

<pre name="code" class="ruby">
require 'ruby_parser'
require 'pp'

pp RubyParser.new.parse(<<-EOF)
def plus_five(n)
  n + 5
end
EOF
</pre>

_Interesting:_

<pre>
s(:defn,
 :plus_five,
 s(:args, :n),
 s(:scope,
   s(:block,
     s(:call, s(:lvar, :n), :+, s(:arglist, s(:lit, 5))))))
</pre>

This is the _syntatic_ strucure of our code. It's not possible to reconstruct
the original snippet character-by-character; you only get what the
compiler/interpreter/virtual machine actually sees. And often that's exactly
the only thing we want.

_Aha.  Who decided this structure and these names by the way?_

Well, I'm not quite certain, but I believe ParseTree by Ryan Davis started it
all.

_Oh, ParseTree sounds familiar._

It extracts the raw AST that Ruby 1.8 uses internally. It's not very elegant,
so Ryan also wrote UnifiedRuby which cleans it up a bit. RubyParser returns
such a cleanup up Sexp.

_And what do people use these cleaned up Sexps for?_

There's plenty of projects floating around, here's some I've heard of:

* "Flog":http://ruby.sadi.st/Flog.html analyzes your code and shows how complex your methods are, and which you should refactor.
* "Flay":http://ruby.sadi.st/Flay.html analyzes your code for structural similarities, ready to be DRYed out!
* "Roodi":http://github.com/martinjandrews/roodi warns you about design issues.
* "Reek":http://github.com/kevinrutherford/reek detects code smells.
* "Saikuro":http://saikuro.rubyforge.org/ is a "cyclomatic complexity analyzer".
* "Ambition":http://ambition.rubyforge.org/ let's you write SQL statements as Ruby blocks.
* "Parkaby":http://github.com/judofyr/parkaby compiles Markaby-like code into super-fast code.
* "RewriteRails":http://github.com/raganwald/rewrite_rails adds syntactic abstractions (like Andand) to Rails projects without monkey-patching.

_Cool, that's more than I thought._

And if more people knew about them, I guess there would be even more.

_Let me recap:_

_For Rubyists, Sexp is an Array-ish list where the first element is the
operator/function and the rest is the operands/arguments. The arguments can
also contain other Sexp. When I think about it, that's probably the most
important thing: They are nested._

_I guess it's mostly useful when we're actually manipulating code that
executes. Like source code or templates?_

Exactly!

_Ah, excellent.  Why were we talking about Sexps again?_

Hm.. Now that's a good question. I simply don't remember. Let's talk about it
another time, shall we?
