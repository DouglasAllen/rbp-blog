=title Requirements Summary of the Laboratory Project
=timestamp 2009.06.08 23:59 +0200
=description Now it's time to collect all the requirements from the discussion threads and put them into some groups.
=entry
I will now take on the role of project secretary and put all requirements into a form suitable for easier reference.  There will be the following groups:

- must (M) := requirement must be fulfilled
- should (S) := requirement should be fulfilled but is not a show stopper
- nice to have (N) := this one is purely optional
- future (F) := this might be a good idea for a later release but should not influence the current version

I will later reference requirements via letter and number, e.g. "S4" refers to "filter by text" requirement (and not a fast car from a German manufacturer).

Until now there was not much reasoning about software although there were some ideas (and even prototypes) mentioned in the discussion thread of the "last article":006-The_Muppet_Project.html.  With the next article I will start to flesh out the architecture (or even some alternatives) along with the reasoning that led to different decisions.

h3. Must have

|_. number|_. description|
| 1|Provide efficient access to all entries of selected interactions|
| 2|Retain ordering of input lines per interaction|
| 3|Parsing needs to be able to identify multi line entries|
| 4|Parsing of lines needs to be easily adjustable to different line formats|
| 5|Analysis must not rely on any particular text to identify first and last lines of an interaction|
| 6|Filter interactions by time range (between a and b, before a, after a)|

h3. Should have

|_. number|_. description|
| 1|Input file names should be provided via command line arguments|
| 2|Analysis should deal gracefully with partial interactions (at the beginning and end of a logfile)|
| 3|Idenfity pauses in interactions with a configurable length and report them|
| 4|Filter interactions by some text contained in messages, ideally via regexp matching|
| 5|Make interactions available in their original formatting|

h3. Nice to have

|_. number|_. description|
| 1|Identification of the proper chronological order of files|
| 2|Read from stdin|
| 3|HTML output|
| 4|Do not use more than 20% on top of a @cat >/dev/null@|
| 5|Statistics about the analysis such as time range, files read, lines read, interactions found etc.|

h3. Future

|_. number|_. description|
| 1|Analysis data stored in a relational database for later analysis with SQL queries|
| 2|Correlate data from different components with different log file naming schemes and formats|

Please let me know if I missed something or there are other mistakes (such as contradictory requirements).
