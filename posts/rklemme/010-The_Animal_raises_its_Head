You can find the first "sample-animal":http://github.com/rklemme/muppet-laboratories/blob/16dc8851554bf29cee37a0dd75a7869c99b10c7d/bin/sample-animal.rb over there at "github":http://github.com/rklemme/muppet-laboratories/tree/master.  Deficits of this version:

* No command line parsing,
* No filtering,
* Works only for moderately sized files,
* No particular optimizations yet (well, apart from freezing of id Strings).

One remark about method @main@: this is the result of asking myself "What is the minimal interface I can provide for users of the Animal and who basically only need to define the parser class?"  At first I found it a bit odd, but in terms of lines of code this is likely one of the leanest solutions.

I'll have to call it a day now, but I invite you to have a look and comment.  Do you consider method @main@ a good idea?  I'll chime in with some more explanations later.
