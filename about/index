<h2>About the <i>Practicing Ruby</i> Blog</h2>

This blog was initially organized by <a href="/about/gregory.html">Gregory Brown</a> as a complementary resource to the <a href="http://rubybestpractices.com">O'Reilly book</a> of the same name.  The goal was to put together a small group of highly motivated Rubyists to provide excellent technical content for the community. With <a href="/about/jamesbritt.html">James Britt</a>, <a href="/about/rklemme.html">Robert Klemme</a>, and <a href="/about/judofyr.html">Magnus Holm</a> rounding out the team, it's safe to say we had that goal well covered.

We were named the "Best New Ruby Blog of 2009":http://www.rubyinside.com/ruby-best-practices-best-new-ruby-blog-1833.html by Ruby Inside, which caused us to gain a dedicated audience of smart folks who regularly participated in discussions here on this blog. However, as time went on, we all got busy with other things and the RBP blog started to die out.

Starting in March 2011, we decided to attempt to breath life back into this blog by releasing a large amount of content that Gregory originally wrote for the paid <i>Practicing Ruby</i> newsletter. Before that project was discontinued, a total of 30 articles were produced, all of which we plan to gradually release to the former RBP blog readers. To reflect this change in direction, we've renamed the blog to <i>Practicing Ruby</i>, which may be a better name for what we're doing here anyway.

While we can't promise that our new experiment will fully revive this blog, it should at least extend the life of it a little bit. We're also hoping that we'll get a chance to once again engage with the audience that made RBP what it was in the first place. It's entirely possible that new discussions on this blog will inspire us to keep producing new content, so please do share your thoughts and questions as you read the content here.

Whether you're a new reader or an old friend, we're glad that you are taking an interest in this project, and look forward to interacting with you soon!
