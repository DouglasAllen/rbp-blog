<h2>About the <i>Practicing Ruby</i> Blog</h2>

This blog was initially organized by <a href="/about/gregory.html">Gregory Brown</a> as a complementary resource to the <a href="http://rubybestpractices.com">Ruby Best Practices</a> book.  The goal was to put together a small group of highly motivated Rubyists to provide excellent technical content for the community. With <a href="/about/jamesbritt.html">James Britt</a>, <a href="/about/rklemme.html">Robert Klemme</a>, and <a href="/about/judofyr.html">Magnus Holm</a> rounding out the team, it's safe to say we had that goal well covered.

We were named the "Best New Ruby Blog of 2009":http://www.rubyinside.com/ruby-best-practices-best-new-ruby-blog-1833.html by Ruby Inside, which caused us to gain a dedicated audience of smart folks who regularly participated in discussions here on this blog. However, as time went on, we all got busy with other things and the RBP blog started to die out.

We have continued to post here from time to time since then, but most of the content we publish here now is mirrored from other places. In particular, Gregory releases content from his <a href="http://practicingruby.com">Practicing Ruby</a> journal here, and Robert Klemme has been mirroring the content from Eric Wong's unix system programming mailing list to this blog as well. We may eventually come back and turn the site into a proper portal for various kinds of contents, but for right now we mostly just post here to reach the former RBP blog subscribers.

Whether you're a new reader or an old friend, we're glad that you are taking an interest in this project, and look forward to interacting with you soon!
