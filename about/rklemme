I have a degree in computer science (with some sprinkles of philosophy) and
live and work in Germany, Europe.  I work as a senior software engineer for a
medium sized company that creates
(and sells!) billing systems for telephone companies. These systems are amazingly complex beasts
as they have a lot connections to other systems, databases, telephone network software
and need real time as well as mass data processing capabilities.
In my work I cover the
whole range of software engineering tasks from design to trouble shooting.

My primary development language is Java and I do a lot SQL and PL/SQL development
for those parts of our software that deal with Oracle databases. I am using Ruby
on a daily basis for different tasks, mostly for

<ul>
<li>Development tools (script based analysis and manipulation of source code,
automation of version control system tasks etc.),</li>
<li>Analysis of system behavior (log file based performance analysis,
bug investigation etc.),</li>
<li>Experimenting (especially finding solutions for interesting problems posted
to <a href="http://blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/ruby/ruby-talk/index.shtml">ruby-talk</a>).</li>
</ul>

When I am writing code (not just Ruby) I try to make it well structured, clear and efficient.
This is what I will try to convey in <a href="../posts/rklemme/">my blog articles</a>.
Suggestions for improvements are welcome!
