<h3>Robert Klemme</h3>

<p>
I live and work in Germany. I am with a medium sized company that creates (and sells!) billing systems for telephone companies. These systems are amazingly complex beasts as they have a lot connections to other systems, databases, telephone network software and need real time as well as mass data processing capabilities. In my work I cover the whole range of software engineering tasks from design to trouble shooting.

<p>
My primary development language is Java and I do a lot SQL and PL/SQL development for those parts of our software that deal with Oracle databases. I am using Ruby on a daily basis for different tasks, mostly for

* Development tools (script based analysis and manipulation of source code, automation of version control system tasks etc.),
* Analysis of system behavior (log file based performance analysis, bug investigation etc.),
* Experimenting (especially finding solutions for interesting problems posted to <a href="http://blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/ruby/ruby-talk/index.shtml">ruby-talk</a>).

When I am writing code (not just Ruby) I try to make it well structured, clear and efficient. This is what I will try to convey in <a href="../posts/rklemme/">my blog articles</a>. Suggestions for improvements are welcome!
