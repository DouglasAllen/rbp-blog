h3. Robert Klemme

I live and work in Germany. I am with a medium sized company that creates (and sells!) billing systems for telephone companies. These systems are amazingly complex beasts as they have a lot connections to other systems, databases, telephone network software and need real time as well as mass data processing capabilities. In my work I cover the whole range of software engineering tasks from design to trouble shooting.

My primary development language is Java and I do a lot SQL and PL/SQL development for those parts of our software that deal with Oracle databases. I am using Ruby on a daily basis for different tasks, mostly for

* Development tools (script based analysis and manipulation of source code, automation of version control system tasks etc.),
* Analysis of system behavior (log file based performance analysis, bug investigation etc.),
* Experimenting (especially finding solutions for interesting problems posted to "ruby-talk":http://blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/ruby/ruby-talk/index.shtml").

When I am writing code (not just Ruby) I try to make it well structured, clear and efficient. This is what I will try to convey in <a href="../posts/rklemme/">my blog articles</a>. Suggestions for improvements are welcome!

In case anybody wonders about my "Gravatar":http://en.gravatar.com/ : it's a homage to "Rowlf":http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Rowlf_the_Dog whom I loved to see appear in the "Mupped Show":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Muppet_Show a _few_ years ago. In case anybody finds him as a hand puppet which is on sale somewhere, please let me know.
