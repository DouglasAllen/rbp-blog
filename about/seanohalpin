h3. Sean O'Halpin

I'm currently a Senior Software Engineer in "Audio and Music Interactive":http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/radiolabs/ at the BBC in London, UK specialising in Ruby and message queues.

I was previously System Architect at Aegis Media UK where I set up the first Rails team in the UK.

I've been programming in Ruby since around the time 1.4 was released and started using it in production when 1.6 came out. My main interest is in metaprogramming, particularly DSLs.

I've written three open source Ruby projects:

* "doodle":http://github.com/seanohalpin/doodle/tree/master: a DSL for extended attribute accessors including validation and conversion
* "ffi-ncurses":http://github.com/seanohalpin/ffi-ncurses/tree/master: a Foreign Function Interface to the ncurses terminal display library
* "smqueue":http://github.com/seanohalpin/smqueue/tree/master: a simple API for messaging systems

I presented about message queuing and virtualisation at RubyConf UK in 2006 ("slides":http://monkeymind.textdriven.com/rails-conf-2006.tar.gz) and about "unobtrusive metaprogramming":http://rubymanor.org/videos/ at Ruby Manor in London in 2008.
