h2. Gregory Brown

I'm the author of the O'Reilly book <a href="http://rubybestpractices.com">Ruby Best Practices</a> and a fairly crunchy person when it comes down to it. I took off half a year in 2008 to work on the PDF generation library "Prawn":http://prawn.majesticseacreature.com, supported by the "kindness of the Ruby community":http://majesticseacreature.com/mendicant. I live in New Haven, CT with my girlfriend, some small animals, and a bamboo plant that seems to live without water.
