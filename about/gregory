h2. Gregory Brown

I'm the author of the O'Reilly book <a href="http://rubybestpractices.com">Ruby Best Practices</a> and a fairly crunchy person when it comes down to it. I took off half a year in 2008 to work on the PDF generation library "Prawn":http://prawn.majesticseacreature.com, supported by the "kindness of the Ruby community":http://majesticseacreature.com/mendicant. I live in New Haven, CT with my girlfriend, some small animals, and a bamboo plant that seems to live without water.

h3. Upcoming Events

* "I was wrong about Ruport"  @ "Mountain West Ruby Conference 2010 (March 11-12)":http://mtnwestrubyconf.org/2010/sessions

h3. Contact

I can be found on Twitter as "@rubypractices":http://twitter.com/rubypractices and "@seacreature":http://twitter.com/seacreature .

I also run the "Majestic Sea Creature":http://majesticseacreature.com blog, and if you're really interested in stalking me, my non-technical writings are at "Meta-Metta":http://metametta.blogspot.com, which I swear I'll eventually dust off.

h3. Hire

Brad Ediger and I have been working together for a couple years now on insanely hard problems, through his company, "Madriska Media Group":http://www.madriska.com/ .  We specialize in turning complex, seemingly enterprisey business problems into robust, simple Ruby solutions.   If you're looking for a couple top notch Ruby hackers with a strong sense of overall project architecture and systems integration, you should contact us.  

We also like to help folks rescue Rails projects that are slipping off the tracks.  We're happy to work with your team, helping to squash bugs, get high priority features out the door, and fill in any gaps in experience with top-notch on the job training.  If this sounds like something you need, we'd love to hear from you.
